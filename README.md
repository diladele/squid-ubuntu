Squid for Ubuntu
============

> Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. It reduces bandwidth and improves response times by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages. Squid has extensive access controls and makes a great server accelerator. It runs on most available operating systems, including Windows and is licensed under the GNU GPL.

**HTTP and HTTPS Filtering Using Squid and ICAP**

In case you need a high quality HTTP(S) traffic filtering solution, we recommend [**Web Safety**](https://www.diladele.com). 

Web Safety for Squid Proxy is an ICAP web filtering server that integrates with Squid proxy server and provides rich content and web filtering functionality to sanitize Internet traffic passing into an internal home/enterprise network. It may be used to block illegal or potentially malicious file downloads, remove annoying advertisements, prevent access to various categories of web sites and block resources with adult/explicit content.
